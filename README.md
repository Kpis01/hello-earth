Just another repository 
Hello there
I am exploring the Repository folders

Note to self (creating a repository and a new branch, editing in branch, pull request and merging with main branch):
(1) Open and name repository, write a short description
(2) Initialize this repo with a 'README'
(3) Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says 'branch: main'
(4) Type branch name and select 'create branch' --> Now you have 2 branches, that look exactly alike
(5) On the new branch, click the pencil icon to start editing
(6) Further down, write a commit message that describes your changes and click 'commit changes'
(7) Click the pull request tab, and click the green 'New pull request'
(8) In 'Example Comparisons' box, select the branch you made (in order to compare with the original file ie Main)
(9) Look over the changes; additions, changes, subtractions are shown in green and red
(10) When you're satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big 'Create pull request'
(11) Give your pull request a title ie readme edits and write a brief description. (My desc is not so brief since i'm writing the entire process to arrive here)
(12) Click 'Merge pull request' to merge changes into 'main', click 'Confirm merge' and delete the branch since its changes have been incorporated
